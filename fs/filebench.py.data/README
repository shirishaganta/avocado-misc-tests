Through avocado yaml file workload file can be passed as param testfile 
it can lies in two category

1: User-defined workloads
First step is to create the description of the workload (so called workload
personality) in WML language. Typically, workload personalities are stored in
files with '.f' extension. In this example we describe a very simple workload
consisting of two processes with three threads each. Every thread continuously
picks a file among many, reads it, and then closes the file. Here is the
corresponding workload personality:

01  define fileset name="testF",entries=10000,filesize=16k,prealloc,path="/tmp"
02
03  define process name="readerP",instances=2 {
04    thread name="readerT",instances=3 {
05      flowop openfile name="openOP",filesetname="testF"
06      flowop readwholefile name="readOP",filesetname="testF"
07      flowop closefile name="closeOP"
08    }
09  }
10
11  run 60
2- There is multiple workload available by default in test suite

Filebench comes with several predefined micro- and macro-workloads (e.g.,
webserver, fileserver, mailserver) which are also described in WML, not
differently than the workload in Example 1 above. In the source code tree,
workloads are located in the workloads/ directory and are typically installed in
/usr/local/share/filebench/workloads/ during 'make install' (though this can
differ from one installation to another).
can be find in /usr/local/share/filebench/workloads/
