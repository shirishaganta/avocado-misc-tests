The disk for which performance of read write operation over a file system has to be measured should be specified in yaml file.
The disk can either be physical disk partition or loop device.
Loop device can be created using dd and losetup commands.
ex:
 dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/image1.img bs=4k count=800000
 losetup /dev/loop1 /home/image1.img
